# Art Gallery Management System

## Project Description

This project is a **relational database system** built using **MySQL** for managing the core data of an Art Gallery. It includes tables for managing artists, artworks, exhibitions, visitors, ticketing, and artwork sales. The system is designed to ensure data integrity, reduce redundancy, and represent real-world relationships between gallery entities using proper SQL constraints and normalization principles.

---

## Objectives

- Design and implement a complete relational database using MySQL.
- Apply best practices in normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
- Use `CREATE TABLE` statements with appropriate data types and constraints.
- Establish 1-to-1, 1-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
- Provide a clear ERD that visualizes the structure and relationships.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE
- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- GitHub
- EER Diagram (Generated with MySQL Workbench)

## How to Set Up / Run the Project

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open MySQL Workbench.
3. Create a new schema (e.g., `art_gallery`).
4. Open the `art_gallery.sql` file provided.
5. Execute the entire script to create all tables.
6. (Optional) Open **File > New Model > Reverse Engineer** in Workbench to generate the EER Diagram.
